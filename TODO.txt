Tentative renamings that we should ponder about
-----------------------------------------------

schunk->typesize  -> schunk->itemsize

   // there is no notion of 'type' in c-blosc2
   // Unfortunately, typesize is being used extensively in c-blosc already,
   // so doing the renaming does not seem like a good idea.
